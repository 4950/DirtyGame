## CSCI 4950: Project Insight: Adapting Games to Players
### University of Minnesota Fall 2013 - Spring 2014
The Senior Project course is designed to give a small group of advanced students 
experience working on a complex, long-term project in a team setting, just like you'd do in the 
real world. As a project course, there are no lectures, homework or exams, just the project. 
Students are in charge of defining the problem, assigning team members to tasks and figuring out 
how to make it all work. 
 
## Info
**Topic:** In many fields of human endeavor, from sales, marketing and design to debate, discussion and dating, an important part of success is adapting to your audience. For this year's senior project, we'll be working on adaptation in video games. The goal of Project Insight is to collect data on game players and use that data to automatically adapt the game to the player.

**Details:** We'll be building an tethered, round-based, 2D, strategic action game. If you've played PvP (head to head) Pokemon, you have the basic idea, although the character system will be more similar to Freedom Force, Naruto and Numenera: Torment. We'll use data mining, opponent modeling, machine learning and behavioral modeling techniques along with state of the art PGG (procedurally-generated content) techniques to accomplish the following goals: procedurally- generated quests, procedurally-generated levels, opponent adaptation, hustling and auto-nerfing.

## Goals
* Learn to integrate material from multiple CS courses.
* Understand the intricacies of data design and analysis.
* Learn professional development practices, including communication and teamwork.
* Experience first-hand what it's like to work on a real-world project.
